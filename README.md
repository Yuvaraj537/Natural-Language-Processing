## 📝 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP bridges **computers and human language**.  

### 🔹 ⚙️ Text Processing Steps
1. ✂️ Tokenization – splitting text into words/sentences.  
2. 🗑️ Stopword Removal – removing common words (is, the, a).  
3. 🔄 Stemming/Lemmatization – reducing words to root form.  
4. 🔢 Vectorization – converting text into numbers (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT).
